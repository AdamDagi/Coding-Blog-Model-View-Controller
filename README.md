AS A developer who writes about tech
I WANT a CMS-style blog site
SO THAT I can publish articles, blog posts, and my thoughts and opinions

* GIVEN a CMS-style blog site
* WHEN I visit the site for the first time
* THEN I am presented with the homepage, which includes existing blog posts if any have been posted; navigation links for the homepage and the dashboard; and the option to log in
* WHEN I click on the homepage option
* THEN I am taken to the homepage
* WHEN I click on any other links in the navigation
* THEN I am prompted to either sign up or sign in
* WHEN I choose to sign up
* THEN I am prompted to create a username and password
* WHEN I click on the sign-up button
* THEN my user credentials are saved and I am logged into the site
* WHEN I revisit the site at a later time and choose to sign in
* THEN I am prompted to enter my username and password
